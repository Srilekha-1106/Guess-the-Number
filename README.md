# GuessTheNumber
A simple game where a random number between 1 and 100 is selected, and the player must guess the number with unlimited attempts. After each guess, one of the following responses will be provided:

If the guess is less than the chosen number: "Your guess is too low."

If the guess is more than the chosen number: "Your guess is too high."

If the guess is equal to the chosen number: "Awesome job, you got it."

Players should use these hints to inform their next guess. The game keeps track of recent attempts, displaying them below to help players analyze their guesses and count the total number of attempts. A Restart Button is available to reset the game and select a new number between 1 and 100.
